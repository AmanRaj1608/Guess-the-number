# Guess The Number

**This is a simple "Guess The Number" game where the user has to guess a number randomly generated by the computer.**

This repository has implementations in C++, JavaScript and Java.

Any implementation currently present in this repository will more or less give an output like this:

```markdown

I'm thinking of a number! Try to guess the number I'm thinking of: 25
Too low! Guess again: 50
Too high! Guess again: 42
That's it! Would you like to play again? (yes/no) no
Thanks for playing!

```
